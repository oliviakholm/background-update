     <h2>I’m Olivia, a marketing student at MSU, Mankato.</h2>
     <p>
      I am working towards a Bachelor’s Degree in Marketing and minoring in graphic design as well as communications. I also received an Associate of Arts Degree while I was in high school from Rainy River Community College, I attended RRCC while participating in the PSEO program. 
     </p>
    
   
    <p>Once I graduate, I hope to find a job in social media or advertising. I really enjoy that both options will allow me to use the knowledge I gained from my education as well as my creativity. I am so thankful that I chose to minor in graphic design, I have noticed that marketing and graphic design go hand in hand, and I believe graphic design experience will give me even more opportunities to find a job that I love. </p>

   
    <p>
     Here I plan to start my portfolio of the creative work I have done during the graphic design courses I have taken within the past year. If you would like to reach out, feel free to connect with me on social media or I can be reached at <a href="mailto: olivia.holm@mnsu.edu">olivia.holm@mnsu.edu.

<h2>Hobbies &amp; Interests</h2>
   <p>
     In my free time I enjoy watching my favorite shows, hanging out with my friends, going on adventures with my boyfriend, and spending time with my family. I have  started listening to podcasts more and I have found a few that I love, although it did take me awhile to find podcasts that suited my interests. I’ve created a list of a few of my favorite podcasts right now, if you’d like to check them out!
